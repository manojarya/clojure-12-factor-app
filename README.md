# Clojure-12-factor-app

When I learnt clojure, I of course had this strong desire to introduce it into my workplace. Now this is a long journey and still is. So I started thinking of the prep-work I will require to do if I really need to make it to production eventually. Apart from convincing my managers and artitects to say yes, there is a lot of work needed to achieve. I work in java shop company. I somehow wanted clojure to make an entry not quietly, not so costly and let others discover its advantages to gain wide range acceptance. So this is an effort to make a production quality template and I thought classic 12-factor should do me good.     

## _Codebase - Git_

We already use Stash. This template is hosted as git repository. If you use anything other than git, please don't. 

## _Dependencies - Leiningen and Maven_

I come from Java world and maven has served me well but when it comes to clj I am fond of Leiningen for its native Clojure appeal.

Sneaking clojure into a java app is one thing but building a clojure project, publishing and maintaining artifacts into your eco system is another matter altogether. I work in a java shop company. We use maven to build and release. So if I have to introduce clojure project into the company then I somehow need to convince the configuration engineers to install, configure Leiningen on all the Jenkins servers. This can be time consuming and involves a lot of explaining and everyone to learn the new DSL and how to do configurations etc and somehow I wanted a faster way. So I did the same that I did with Clojure. I snuck clojure into java app and started using Interop and Persistent data structures. Why not do the same with Lein. Use maven to do lein project as use Java did for clojure.

lein pom

## _Config - properties and edn_

Make a choice. If you have play to the gallary, and don't want to disrupt your java .properties files based mechanism that is also fine else I will strongly recommened Clojure's edn. The data format used in Datomic.


## _Disposability - stuart sierra's component_

In clojure, the long awaiting answer I got to the state in the system was from Conj talk by Stuart Sierra. I was really confused on how will manage state in a big clojure app without it being messy or passing all the things all the time. This makes your program state easy to reason with, visible and start/stop at will.

## _Logs - clj logging and logback_

Configured clojure tools logging and logback.
